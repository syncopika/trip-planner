grrrrrr lol - https://blog.francium.tech/vue-js-and-html5-contenteditable-attribute-issues-c727734c7684
I tried to remove li nodes that contenteditable was creating, which sort of worked, but not good enough
- decided to go with textarea instead :D

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50635199/vue-js-2-0-child-component-mounted-callback
- consider making the iframe for the map into a child component! then you can listen for that to
  be all set up and ready before running mounted() code in the parent? not sure this'll guarantee
  that the iframe is ready to listen for events though but worth a try?

========================
anything in src gets processed by webpack.put stuff in /public and then reference with relative path like './mapIframe.html'
I got super confused though because I got it working with the relative path after I moved my mapIframe.html and its js file 
to src/assets. but then it stopped working and moving those files to /public got it working again :/

TODO:
- emit events rather than calling root?
- use Vuex to store trip data upon loading from some source?

now:
- set zoom level?
- rename trip title
- reorder dests
- customize note text properties (i.e. font color, font size)? think accessibility?
- download/import json? might be too difficult with images though

later:
- geocoding> get closest city? guess name of destination?
- use a calendar to set toDate and fromDate for destinations
- use a color picker for setting route line colors between destinations?
