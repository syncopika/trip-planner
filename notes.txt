grrrrrr lol - https://blog.francium.tech/vue-js-and-html5-contenteditable-attribute-issues-c727734c7684
I tried to remove li nodes that contenteditable was creating, which sort of worked, but not good enough
- decided to go with textarea instead :D

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50635199/vue-js-2-0-child-component-mounted-callback
- consider making the iframe for the map into a child component! then you can listen for that to
  be all set up and ready before running mounted() code in the parent? not sure this'll guarantee
  that the iframe is ready to listen for events though but worth a try?

anything in src gets processed by webpack.put stuff in /public and then reference with relative path like './mapIframe.html'
I got super confused though because I got it working with the relative path after I moved my mapIframe.html and its js file 
to src/assets. but then it stopped working and moving those files to /public got it working again :/

TODO:
- when the map is interacted with and those events are caught, make sure those changes (i.e. adding a destination) are caught and the
child components are updated accordingly.
	- the initial load is tricky: I think the iframe might not be ready to listen for events when the component it's in
          has already mounted. so maybe make the iframe into a new Vue component?

- be able to delete a destination.

- connect map markers with a line
