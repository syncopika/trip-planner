db stuff

db name: trip_planner_test

3 tables (users, destinations, userdestinations):
users 
=======
id serial // primary key
username varchar(60) unique => make primary key instead and delete id?
password varchar(60)

destinations
============
id serial // primary key
destname varchar(60)
tripname varchar(60)
index int 		// the index of the destination for the trip it belongs to. not sure this is a good idea.
latitude decimal (10,8)
longitude decimal (11,8)
metadata jsonb          // contains info about the destination like notes, start date, end date, etc.

userdestinations (matches users to their destinations)
===============
user_id
destination_id

// we should prevent duplicate records from being inserted (but to know that we need to look at multiple columns I think)

TODO:
- ui improvements + make more mobile friendly (i.e. collapse navbar into a hamburger menu?)
- pay attention to eslint warnings and fix them?
- testing for core components
- get a dummy map tile iframe for demoing? done but this one might be good to use too: https://maputnik.github.io/osm-liberty/

now:
- set zoom level?
- rename trip title (partially done - need to update the actual data set with the new edit though if the change is valid)
- reorder dests
- customize note text properties (i.e. font color, font size)? think accessibility?
- expected data format for importing/exported files?
- show the range for suggested next hops as a circle (this one will be challenging because we need to pass the radius around
  and we are not set up for that :/)

later:
- emit events rather than calling root?
- use Vuex to store trip data upon loading from some source?
- geocoding> get closest city? guess name of destination?
