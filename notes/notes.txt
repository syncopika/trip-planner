db name: trip_planner_test

2 tables:

// we should prevent duplicate records from being inserted (but to know that we need to look at multiple columns I think)

TODO:
- bug: when switching between trips, the paths between markers still stay on the map. they should be erased when switching.
- testing for core components
- get a dummy map tile iframe for demoing? done but this one might be good to use too: https://maputnik.github.io/osm-liberty/

now:
- set zoom level?
- rename trip title
- reorder dests
- customize note text properties (i.e. font color, font size)? think accessibility?
- expected data format for importing/exported files?

later:
- emit events rather than calling root?
- use Vuex to store trip data upon loading from some source?
- geocoding> get closest city? guess name of destination?
