TODO:
- testing for core components
- get a dummy map tile iframe for demoing? done but this one might be good to use too: https://maputnik.github.io/osm-liberty/

now:
- set zoom level?
- customize note text properties (i.e. font color, font size)? think accessibility?
- expected data format for importing/exported files?
- allow user to set radius of area to get suggested next dests from
- get rid of using any and ts-ignores as much as possible
- bug with showing next dest -> seems to show in-range suggestions for the prev dest?

later:
- emit events rather than calling root?
- use Vuex to store trip data upon loading from some source?
- geocoding> get closest city? guess name of destination?
